#"Zombie", the Cranberries lyrics
--------------------------------------------

##1. 
Another head hangs lowly

Child is slowly taken

And if violence causes the silence

Who are we mistaking

But you see it's not me

It's not my family

In your head in your head

They are fighting


##2.

With their tanks and their bombs

And their bombs and their guns

In your head in your head they are crying




###[Chorus]

In your head

In your head

Zombie zombie zombie ei ei

What's in your head

In your head.

Zombie, zombie, zombie ei, ei, ei, oh do,do,do,do,do,do,do,do




##3.

Another mother's breaking heart is taking over the violence causes silence

We must be mistaken

It's the same old thing since 1916

In your head in your head

Their still fighting

With their tanks and their bombs

And their bombs and their guns

In your head in your head they are dying




###[Chorus repeats]
